        <h3 id="first-paragraph">First Paragraph</h3>
        <p>Starship is a rocket made out of stainless steel by <span class="spacex">SpaceX</span>, a company that works in the atmosphere and space. The rocket is made of two stages: Super Heavy and Starship. Both of these stages can be used again. This is unusual for a rocket. The rocket can lift 100 t (220,000 lb) of people and things to orbit. It can also travel to the Moon and Mars. There are many different ways Starship can be used. It can do many things from serving space tourists, to helping humans going to Mars. </p>

        <h3>Second Paragraph</h3>
        <p>Before launch, liquid oxygen and liquid methane fill Starship's tanks. Then, 33 Raptor engines fire and lift the rocket up. Super Heavy and Starship will then separate. After that, the Starship spacecraft boosts itself into orbit. The booster then descends and lands on the launch tower's arms. When Starship lands, the spacecraft will glide using its flaps. At the last few seconds, the spacecraft flips up and land. </p>
        
        <h4>Third Paragraph</h4>
        <p>Since 2005,<span class="SpaceX"> SpaceX</span> has been working on ideas similar to Starship. The company then checks the design with a series of tests: from flying 150 m (0.09 mi) high in July 2019, to flying 10 km (6 mi) high in May 2021.  A first orbital flight test is planned for April 2023.
